# Project Overview

This is a project of separate, unrelated, simple websites.

## Project Structure

*   Each website exists in its own folder.
*   Each website folder contains only three files:
    *   `app.js`
    *   `style.css`
    *   `index.html`
*   **Important**: Do not add any additional files to these folders.

## Development Constraints

*   All code must be kept as simple as possible.
*   No external dependencies (CSS frameworks, JavaScript frameworks, etc.) are allowed.
*   Do not include any resources from outside this project in the HTML files.
